\chapter{Preface}

This novel was generated from the text of Gustavus Hindman Miller's \textit{Ten
Thousand Dreams, Interpreted}. The ``What's In A Dream'' section of Miller's
book functions as a dream dictionary: you look up a word, and find out what it
means to dream about that word's referent. Each word has multiple interpretations,
and most of these interpretations can be broken down into what I
call an \textit{action} and a \textit{denotation}:

\begin{quote}
To see an oak full of acorns, denotes increase and promotion.
\end{quote}

In this entry, \textit{See an oak full of acorns} is the action, and
\textit{increase and promotion} is the denotation. The text of this novel was
made by extracting the actions and changing them to first-person, past-tense
sentences:

\begin{quote}
I saw an oak full of acorns.
\end{quote}

The denotation for each action is scored using a sentiment analysis algorithm,
and the sentences are printed in order by the sentiment of their corresponding
denotation, from most negative to most positive. (According to the sentiment
analysis algorithm, the first sentence of the novel, ``I saw a healthy belly,'' is the worst
thing that can happen in a dream; the last sentence, ``I waded in clear water,''
is the best thing.)

Elaborations, in the form of footnotes, are provided for many sentences. These
elaborations are generated using information in ConceptNet (in particular, the
\textit{IsA}, \textit{HasProperty}, and \textit{AtLocation} relations) and WordNet (for part-of-speech
checks, synonyms, and antonyms).
